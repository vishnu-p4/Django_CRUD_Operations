# Django CRUD Project

This Django-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application demonstrates fundamental web development operations using the Django framework. The project includes a fully functional interface that allows users to:

Create new records through validated web forms

Read and view data entries in a structured layout

Update existing records with real-time form editing

Delete entries with confirmation prompts to prevent accidental removal

The backend leverages Djangoâ€™s ORM to interact with the database efficiently, ensuring data integrity and scalability. The frontend is designed using Django templates, with optional enhancements like Bootstrap for responsive UI design.

This project serves as a foundational template for more complex web applications, showcasing key Django features such as:

URL routing

Views (Class-based or Function-based)

Models and migrations

Django admin integration

Form handling and validation

Template rendering

Ideal for beginners or as a boilerplate for advanced applications, this CRUD project provides a clear example of how Django can be used to build robust, maintainable web applications quickly.
